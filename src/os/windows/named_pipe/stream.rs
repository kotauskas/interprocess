/// A named pipe stream, created by a server-side listener or by connecting to a server.
///
/// This type combines in itself all possible combinations of
/// [receive modes and send modes](pipe_mode), plugged into it using the `Rm` and `Sm` generic
/// parameters respectively.
///
/// Pipe streams can be split by reference and by value for concurrent receive and send operations.
/// Splitting by reference is ephemeral and can be achieved by simply borrowing the stream, since
/// both `PipeStream` and `&PipeStream` implement I/O traits. Splitting by value is done using the
/// [`.split()`](Self::split) method, producing a receive half and a send half, and can be reverted
/// via [`.reunite()`](PipeStream::reunite).
///
/// # Semantic peculiarities
/// - [`BrokenPipe`](io::ErrorKind::BrokenPipe) errors in bytestreams are converted to EOF (`Ok(0)`)
/// - Upon drop, streams that haven't been flushed since the last send are transparently sent to
///   **limbo** – a thread pool that ensures that the peer does not get a `BrokenPipe` (EOF if peer
///   also uses Interprocess) immediately after the server is done sending data, which would discard
///   everything
///     - At the time of dropping, if the stream hasn't seen a single send since the last explicit
///       flush, it will evade limbo (can be overriden with
///       [`.mark_dirty()`](PipeStream::mark_dirty))
/// - Flush elision, analogous to limbo elision but also happens on explicit flush (i.e. flushing
///   two times in a row only makes one system call)
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Basic bytestream client
/// ```no_run
/// use interprocess::os::windows::named_pipe::*;
/// use std::io::{BufReader, prelude::*};
///
/// // Preemptively allocate a sizeable buffer for receiving.
/// // This size should be enough and should be easy to find for the allocator.
/// let mut buffer = String::with_capacity(128);
///
/// // Create our connection. This will block until the server accepts our connection, but will fail
/// // immediately if the server hasn't even started yet; somewhat similar to how happens with TCP,
/// // where connecting to a port that's not bound to any server will send a "connection refused"
/// // response, but that will take twice the ping, the roundtrip time, to reach the client.
/// let conn = DuplexPipeStream::<pipe_mode::Bytes>::connect("Example")?;
/// // Wrap it into a buffered reader right away so that we could receive a single line out of it.
/// let mut conn = BufReader::new(conn);
///
/// // Send our message into the stream. This will finish either when the whole message has been
/// // sent or if a send operation returns an error. (`.get_mut()` is to get the sender,
/// // `BufReader` doesn't implement a pass-through `Write`.)
/// conn.get_mut().write_all(b"Hello from client!\n")?;
///
/// // We now employ the buffer we allocated prior and receive a single line, interpreting a newline
/// // character as an end-of-file (because local sockets cannot be portably shut down), verifying
/// // validity of UTF-8 on the fly.
/// conn.read_line(&mut buffer)?;
///
/// // Print out the result, getting the newline for free!
/// print!("Server answered: {buffer}");
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// ## Basic message stream client
/// ```no_run
/// use recvmsg::prelude::*;
/// use interprocess::os::windows::named_pipe::*;
///
/// // Preemptively allocate a sizeable buffer for receiving. Keep in mind that this will depend on
/// // the specifics of the protocol you're using.
/// let mut buffer = MsgBuf::from(Vec::with_capacity(128));
///
/// // Create our connection. This will block until the server accepts our connection, but will fail
/// // immediately if the server hasn't even started yet; somewhat similar to how happens with TCP,
/// // where connecting to a port that's not bound to any server will send a "connection refused"
/// // response, but that will take twice the ping, the roundtrip time, to reach the client.
/// let mut conn = DuplexPipeStream::<pipe_mode::Messages>::connect("Example")?;
///
/// // Here's our message so that we could check its length later.
/// static MESSAGE: &[u8] = b"Hello from client!";
/// // Send the message, getting the amount of bytes that was actually sent in return.
/// let sent = conn.send(MESSAGE)?;
/// assert_eq!(sent, MESSAGE.len()); // If it doesn't match, something's seriously wrong.
///
/// // Use the reliable message receive API, which gets us a `RecvResult` from the
/// // `reliable_recv_msg` module.
/// conn.recv_msg(&mut buffer, None)?;
///
/// // Convert the data that's been received into a string. This checks for UTF-8
/// // validity, and if invalid characters are found, a new buffer is
/// // allocated to house a modified version of the received data, where
/// // decoding errors are replaced with those diamond-shaped question mark
/// // U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER thingies: �.
/// let received_string = String::from_utf8_lossy(buffer.filled_part());
///
/// // Print out the result!
/// println!("Server answered: {received_string}");
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
