/// A Tokio-based named pipe stream, created by a server-side listener or by connecting to a server.
///
/// This type combines in itself all possible combinations of receive modes and send modes, plugged
/// into it using the `Rm` and `Sm` generic parameters respectively.
///
/// Pipe streams can be split by reference and by value for concurrent receive and send operations.
/// Splitting by reference is ephemeral and can be achieved by simply borrowing the stream, since
/// both `PipeStream` and `&PipeStream` implement the I/O traits. Splitting by value is done using
/// the [`.split()`](Self::split) method, producing a receive half and a send half, and can be
/// reverted via [`.reunite()`](Self::reunite).
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Basic bytestream client
/// ```no_run
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
/// use tokio::{io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt}, try_join};
/// use interprocess::os::windows::named_pipe::{pipe_mode, tokio::*};
///
/// // Await this here since we can't do a whole lot without a connection.
/// let conn = DuplexPipeStream::<pipe_mode::Bytes>::connect("Example").await?;
///
/// // This consumes our connection and splits it into two owned halves, so that we could
/// // concurrently act on both. Take care not to use the .split() method from the futures crate's
/// // AsyncReadExt.
/// let (mut recver, mut sender) = conn.split();
///
/// // Preemptively allocate a sizeable buffer for receiving.
/// // This size should be enough and should be easy to find for the allocator.
/// let mut buffer = String::with_capacity(128);
///
/// // Describe the send operation as sending our whole string, waiting for
/// // that to complete, and then shutting down the send half, which sends
/// // an EOF to the other end to help it determine where the message ends.
/// let send = async {
///     sender.write_all(b"Hello from client!").await?;
///     sender.shutdown().await?;
///     Ok(())
/// };
///
/// // Describe the receive operation as receiving until EOF into our big buffer.
/// let recv = recver.read_to_string(&mut buffer);
///
/// // Concurrently perform both operations: send-and-invoke-EOF and receive.
/// try_join!(send, recv)?;
///
/// // Get rid of those here to close the receive half too.
/// drop((recver, sender));
///
/// // Display the results when we're done!
/// println!("Server answered: {}", buffer.trim());
/// # Ok(()) }
