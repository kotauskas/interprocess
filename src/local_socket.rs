//! Local sockets, an IPC primitive featuring a server and multiple clients connecting to that
//! server using a filesystem path inside a special namespace, each having a private connection to
//! that server.
//!
//! ## Implementation types
//! Local sockets are not a real IPC method implemented by the OS – they exist to smooth out the
//! difference between two types of underlying implementation: **Unix domain sockets** and
//! **Windows named pipes**. The [`ImplType`] enumeration documents them and provides methods to
//! query whether they are available and their implementation specifics.
//!
//! ### Implementation properties
//! Implementations of the exact same IPC primitive can have subtly different feature sets on
//! different platforms and even on different versions of the same OS. For example, only on Linux
//! and Windows do Unix-domain sockets support the "anonymous namespace" (and thus feature
//! [`NameTypeSupport::Both`]); on FreeBSD, macOS and the likes, only file paths are available.
//!
//! The [`ImplProperties`] struct, as obtained through [`ImplType`]'s methods, is a source of
//! information on all possible differences between different implementations of local sockets. This
//! is to say that equal [`ImplProperties`] correspond to the same observable behavior of the IPC
//! primitive – if there are any other differences that affect the public API but are not documented
//! by [`ImplProperties`] (besides the mere fact that different IPC primitives use different system
//! APIs), that's a bug in Interprocess!
//!
//! ### Platform-specific namespaces
//! Since only Linux supports putting Unix-domain sockets in a separate namespace which is isolated
//! from the filesystem, the `LocalSocketName`/`LocalSocketNameBuf` types are used to identify local
//! sockets rather than `OsStr`/`OsString`: on Unix platforms other than Linux, which includes
//! macOS, all flavors of BSD and possibly other Unix-like systems, the only way to name a
//! Unix-domain socket is to use a filesystem path. As such, those platforms don't have the
//! namespaced socket creation method available. Complicatng matters further, Windows does not
//! support named pipes in the normal filesystem, meaning that namespaced local sockets are the only
//! functional method on Windows.
//!
//! As a way to solve this issue, [`LocalSocketName`]/`LocalSocketNameBuf` only provide creation in
//! a platform-specific way, meaning that crate users are required to query [`NameTypeSupport`] to
//! decide on the socket names.
//!
//! ## Differences from regular sockets
//! A few missing features, primarily on Windows, require local sockets to omit some important
//! functionality, because code relying on it wouldn't be portable. Some notable differences are:
//! - No `.shutdown()` – your communication protocol must manually negotiate end of transmission.
//!   Notably, `.read_to_string()` and `.read_all()` will always block indefinitely at some point.
//! - No datagram sockets – the difference in semantics between connectionless datagram Unix-domain
//!   sockets and connection-based named message pipes on Windows does not allow bridging those two
//!   into a common API. You can emulate datagrams on top of streams anyway, so no big deal, right?
