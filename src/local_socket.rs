//! Local sockets, a socket-like IPC primitive in which clients access a server through a
//! filesystem path or an identifier inside a special namespace, with each client having a
//! private connection to the server.
//!
//! ## Implementations and dispatch
//! Local sockets are not a real IPC primitive implemented by the OS, but rather a construct of
//! Interprocess that is implemented in terms of an underlying IPC primitive. Different IPC
//! primitives are available on different platforms and have different capabilities and
//! limitations. As such, the types representing local sockets that you can find in this
//! module – [`Listener`], [`Stream`], [`RecvHalf`], [`SendHalf`] – are really enums in the style
//! of `enum_dispatch` that contain variants for all the different implementations of local
//! sockets that are available, and the types that they dispatch between are talked to via the
//! corresponding [`Listener`](traits::Listener), [`Stream`](traits::Stream)
//! [`RecvHalf`](traits::RecvHalf), [`SendHalf`](traits::SendHalf) traits that you can find in the
//! [`traits`] module. (Note that this dispatch is currently zero-cost on all platforms, as there
//! is only one underlying local socket implementation per platform, with Windows only using named
//! pipe based local sockets and Unix only using Unix-domain socket based local sockets, but this
//! may change in the future with the introduction of support for
//! [the Windows implementation of Unix-domain sockets][udswnd]. Even then, the overhead of this
//! dispatch is insignificant compared to the overhead of making the system calls that perform
//! the actual communication.)
//!
//! [udswnd]: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/af_unix-comes-to-windows/
//!
//! The [`prelude`] module is there to make it easier to handle all of this complexity without
//! suffering from naming collisions. **`use interprocess::local_socket::prelude::*;` is the
//! recommended way of bringing local sockets into scope.**
//!
//! ## Stability
//! Since interprocess communication cannot happen without agreement on a protocol between two or
//! more processes, the mapping of local sockets to underlying primitives is stable and
//! predictable. **The IPC primitive selected depends only on the current platform and the
//! [name type](NameType) used.** The mapping is trivial unless noted otherwise (in particular,
//! Interprocess never inserts its own message framing or any other type of metadata into the
//! stream – the bytes you write are the exact bytes that come out the other end), which means
//! that the portable API of local sockets is suitable for communicating with programs that do
//! not use Interprocess themselves, including programs not written in Rust. All you need to do
//! is use the correct name type for every platform.
//!
//! ## Raw handle and file descriptor access
//! The enum dispatchers purposely omit implementations of `{As,Into,From}Raw{Handle,Fd}`,
//! `As{Handle,Fd}`, `From<Owned{HandleFd}>` and `Into<Owned{Handle,Fd}>`. To access those trait
//! implementations on the underlying implementation types, you need to match on the enum. For
//! instance:
//! ```no_run
//! # #[cfg(unix)]
//! use {interprocess::local_socket::prelude::*, std::os::unix::prelude::*};
//! # #[cfg(unix)] fn hi(fd: OwnedFd, fd2: OwnedFd) {
//!
//! // Creating a stream from a file descriptor
//! let stream = LocalSocketStream::UdSocket(fd.into());
//! # let _ = stream;
//!
//! // Consuming a stream to get its file descriptor
//! let fd = match stream {
//!     LocalSocketStream::UdSocket(s) => OwnedFd::from(s),
//! };
//! # let _ = fd;
//!
//! # let stream = LocalSocketStream::UdSocket(fd2.into());
//! // Accessing a stream's file descriptor without taking ownership
//! let stream_impl = match &stream {
//!     LocalSocketStream::UdSocket(s) => s,
//! };
//! let fd = stream_impl.as_fd();
//! # let _ = fd;
//!
//! // Listener, RecvHalf, and SendHalf work analogously.
//! // Works just the same on Windows under the replacement of Fd with Handle.
//! # }
//! ```
