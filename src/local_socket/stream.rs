/// socket.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Basic client
/// ```no_run
/// use interprocess::local_socket::{LocalSocketStream, NameTypeSupport};
/// use std::io::{prelude::*, BufReader};
///
/// // Pick a name. There isn't a helper function for this, mostly because it's largely unnecessary:
/// // in Rust, `match` is your concise, readable and expressive decision making construct.
/// let name = {
///     // This scoping trick allows us to nicely contain the import inside the `match`, so that if
///     // any imports of variants named `Both` happen down the line, they won't collide with the
///     // enum we're working with here. Maybe someone should make a macro for this.
///     use NameTypeSupport::*;
///     match NameTypeSupport::query() {
///         OnlyPaths => "/tmp/example.sock",
///         OnlyNamespaced | Both => "@example.sock",
///     }
/// };
///
/// // Preemptively allocate a sizeable buffer for receiving.
/// // This size should be enough and should be easy to find for the allocator.
/// let mut buffer = String::with_capacity(128);
///
/// // Create our connection. This will block until the server accepts our connection, but will fail
/// // immediately if the server hasn't even started yet; somewhat similar to how happens with TCP,
/// // where connecting to a port that's not bound to any server will send a "connection refused"
/// // response, but that will take twice the ping, the roundtrip time, to reach the client.
/// let conn = LocalSocketStream::connect(name)?;
/// // Wrap it into a buffered reader right away so that we could receive a single line out of it.
/// let mut conn = BufReader::new(conn);
///
/// // Send our message into the stream. This will finish either when the whole message has been
/// // sent or if a send operation returns an error. (`.get_mut()` is to get the sender,
/// // `BufReader` doesn't implement pass-through `Write`.)
/// conn.get_mut().write_all(b"Hello from client!\n")?;
///
/// // We now employ the buffer we allocated prior and receive a single line, interpreting a newline
/// // character as an end-of-file (because local sockets cannot be portably shut down), verifying
/// // validity of UTF-8 on the fly.
/// conn.read_line(&mut buffer)?;
///
/// // Print out the result, getting the newline for free!
/// print!("Server answered: {buffer}");
/// # std::io::Result::<()>::Ok(())
