/// ## Basic client
/// ```no_run
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
/// use interprocess::local_socket::{tokio::LocalSocketStream, NameTypeSupport};
/// use tokio::{io::{AsyncBufReadExt, AsyncWriteExt, BufReader}, try_join};
///
/// // Pick a name. There isn't a helper function for this, mostly because it's largely unnecessary:
/// // in Rust, `match` is your concise, readable and expressive decision making construct.
/// let name = {
///     // This scoping trick allows us to nicely contain the import inside the `match`, so that if
///     // any imports of variants named `Both` happen down the line, they won't collide with the
///     // enum we're working with here. Maybe someone should make a macro for this.
///     use NameTypeSupport::*;
///     match NameTypeSupport::query() {
///         OnlyPaths => "/tmp/example.sock",
///         OnlyNamespaced | Both => "@example.sock",
///     }
/// };

/// // Await this here since we can't do a whole lot without a connection.
/// let conn = LocalSocketStream::connect(name).await?;
///
/// // This consumes our connection and splits it into two halves,
/// // so that we can concurrently use both.
/// let (recver, mut sender) = conn.split();
/// let mut recver = BufReader::new(recver);
///
/// // Allocate a sizeable buffer for receiving.
/// // This size should be enough and should be easy to find for the allocator.
/// let mut buffer = String::with_capacity(128);
///
/// // Describe the send operation as writing our whole string.
/// let send = sender.write_all(b"Hello from client!\n");
