/// Types which can be converted to a local socket name.
///
/// The difference between this trait and [`TryInto`]`<`[`LocalSocketName`]`>` is that the latter
/// does not constrain the error type to be [`io::Error`] and thus is not compatible with many types
/// from the standard library which are widely expected to be convertible to Unix domain socket
/// paths. Additionally, this makes the special syntax for namespaced sockets possible (see below).
///
/// ## `@` syntax for namespaced paths
/// As mentioned in the [`LocalSocketName` documentation][`LocalSocketName`], there are two types of
/// which local socket names can be: filesystem paths and namespaced names. Those are isolated from
/// each other – there's no portable way to represent one using another, though certain OSes might
/// provide ways to do so – Windows does, for example. To be able to represent both in a
/// platform-independent fashion, a special syntax was implemented in implementations of this trait
/// on types from the standard library: "@ syntax".
///
/// The feature, in its core, is extremely simple: if the first character in a string is the @
/// character, the value of the string is interpreted and stored as a namespaced name (otherwise,
/// it's treated as a filesystem path); the @ character is then removed from the string (by taking a
/// subslice which dosen't include it if a string slice is being used; for owned strings, it's
/// simply removed from the string by shifting the entire string towards the beginning). **[`Path`]
/// and [`PathBuf`] are not affected at all – those have explicit path semantics and therefore
/// cannot logically represent namespaced names.**
///
/// This feature is extremely useful both when using hardcoded literals and accepting user input for
/// the path, but sometimes you might want to prevent this behavior. In such a case, you have the
/// following possible approaches:
/// - If the string is a [`OsStr`]/[`OsString`], it can be cheaply converted to a
///   [`Path`]/[`PathBuf`], which do not support the @ syntax
/// - If the string is a [`str`]/[`String`], it can be cheaply converted to [`OsStr`]/[`OsString`];
///   then the above method can be applied
/// - If the string is a [`CStr`]/[`CString`], it can be converted to [`str`]/[`String`] using the
///   following code:
/// ```no_run
/// # use std::{
/// #     str::Utf8Error,
/// #     ffi::{CStr, CString},
/// # };
/// fn cstr_to_str(val: &CStr) -> Result<&str, Utf8Error> {
///     std::str::from_utf8(val.to_bytes_with_nul())
/// }
/// fn cstring_to_string(val: CString) -> String {
///     String::from_utf8_lossy(&val.into_bytes_with_nul()).into()
/// }
/// ```
/// Then, the method for [`str`]/[`String`] can be applied.
///
/// None of the above conversions perform memory allocations – the only expensive one is
/// [`CStr`]/[`CString`] which performs a check for valid UTF-8.
